				<h4 class="articleHeader">Who invented solar energy?</h4>
			<p>
				Solar energy is actually nothing new. People have used solar power as far back in history as the 7th century B.C. In its most primitive state, energy from the sun has been revered and put to use almost as long as man has walked the earth.

				The earliest uses of solar power included focusing the sun’s energy through a magnifying glass to start fires for cooking. By the 3rd century B.C., Greeks and Romans bounced sunlight off of “burning mirrors” to light sacred torches for religious ceremonies.

				Sunrooms were invented in ancient times to capture solar energy for its natural warmth.

				<h4 class="articleHeader"> What are charge controllers and how do they work?</h4>
				<p>
				A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current is added to or drawn from electric batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent completely draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life. The terms "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a stand-alone device, or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered device, or battery charger.

			<article class="article3battery">
				<h4 class="articleHeader"> Why it is suggested use a battery system?</h4>
				<p>
					It is suggested to use a battery system, when installing a solar panel system, because it can boost the average solar home’s use of solar power from around 25% to as high as 80%. This means using solar power day and night, and reducing the amount of expensive electricity you have to buy from your power company. 
					In this way solar batteries are also cost effective. Buying less electricity, especially during the evening peak, means “your bills go down.”

			<article class="article4dc">
				<h4 class="articleHeader">What is Direct Current(DC)?</h4>
				<p>
					Direct current (DC) is the one directional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.

			<article class="article5inverter">
				<h4 class="articleHeader">What is a solar inverter?</h4>
			<p>
				A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter which converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical balance of system (BOS)–component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment.

			<article class="article6acpow">
				<h4 class="articleHeader"> What is AC (Alternating Current)? </h4>
			<p>
				Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight.
